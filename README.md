# EAGL
## A PHP Framework for making websites

EAGL — pronounced “eagle” — is built with pure PHP, and includes a `config.php` file to list all stylesheets and scripts to load on your page, in order. In addition, EAGL has developer options to turn off stylesheets and specify a legacy stylesheet just for older browsers.
